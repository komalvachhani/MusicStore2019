# MusicStore2019
I created a Music Store Application in Grade 11 Computer Science (2019) using Java. With my current experience level, I go back to look at my old coding habits in shock. Thought I'd put it on my GitHub for documentation purposes!

This was created when I was still learning the basics of programming - this means my efficiency is something that can be improved upon infinitely. 

This project is also all consol-based. Maybe one day I can create an interface for this app!
